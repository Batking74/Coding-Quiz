# Coding Quiz

### Description
This coding quiz project was a little fun project to challenge myself and practice traversing through the DOM, utilizing localstorage, and utilizing Web Aplication Programming Interfaces (API's) in Javascript.

- I was motivated to do this project to better my skills, and create my own experience using those tools.
